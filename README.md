# pianokeys

This is a simple web app created for piano players, allowing them to learn note names and their position on the piano at the same time. You can select between the clefs and choose between three difficulties. 
The other goal of this project was for me to learn some javascript and to refamiliarize myself with HTML and CSS.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- Overall code sloppiness (it has no business being so terrible)
- Maybe the least adaptable web page ever, it currently only looks good on my monitor
- Radio styling looks pretty rough but I am too lazy to completely rework it
- Answer display alignment is a bit wonky

THINGS I USED:

- "Build A Piano With Javascript - Tutorial" by Web Dev Simplified - https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Piano.git - used for a portion of the keyboard
- "How To Build A Simple Card Game With JavaScript" by Web Dev Simplified - https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/War-Card-Game.git - used some of the deck logic
- Piano-Sounds-High-Quality- - https://github.com/daviddeborin/Piano-Sounds-High-Quality-.git - used the piano key sounds
